abstract: >-
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized
  the NLP field, while they still fall short in some
  specific down-stream tasks. In the work, we focus on
  utilizing LLMs to perform machine translation, where we
  observe that two patterns of errors frequently occur and
  drastically affect the translation quality: language
  mismatch and repetition. The work sets out to explore the
  potential for mitigating these two issues by leveraging
  model editing methods, e.g., by locating Feed-Forward
  Network (FFN) neurons or something that are responsible
  for the errors and deactivating them in the inference
  time. We find that directly applying such methods either
  limited effect on the targeted errors or has significant
  negative side-effect on the general translation quality,
  indicating that the located components may also be crucial
  for ensuring machine translation with LLMs on the rails.
  To this end, we propose to refine the located components
  by fetching the intersection of the locating results under
  different language settings, filtering out the
  aforementioned information that is irrelevant to targeted
  errors. The experiment results empirically demonstrate
  that our methods can effectively reduce the language
  mismatch and repetition ratios and meanwhile enhance or
  keep the general translation quality in most cases.
